### Housing Tenure and Distribution
9. **Distribution of population by tenure status** (ilc_lvho02)

## Migration-Related Datasets from Eurostat

### Immigration Statistics
1. **Immigration by age group, sex and citizenship** (migr_imm1ctz)  
   *ELI5*: Counts how many people moved to each country, broken down by age, gender, and nationality.

2. **Immigration by age group, sex and country of birth** (migr_imm3ctb)  
   *ELI5*: Similar to above but focused on where immigrants were born rather than their citizenship.

3. **Immigration by age, sex and group of citizenship** (migr_imm2ctz)  
   *ELI5*: Groups immigrants by whether they're from EU countries or non-EU countries.

### Emigration Statistics
4. **Emigration by age group, sex and citizenship** (migr_emi1ctz)  
   *ELI5*: Counts how many people left each country, by age, gender, and nationality.

5. **Emigration by age group, sex and country of birth** (migr_emi4ctb)  
   *ELI5*: Shows outward migration based on where people were born.

### Migration Balance and Population Structure
6. **Net migration by age and sex** (migr_netmigr)  
   *ELI5*: Shows the balance between people entering and leaving a country (immigration minus emigration).

7. **Proportion of population by age group, sex and citizenship** (demo_poppcctz)  
   *ELI5*: Shows what percentage of the population are nationals versus foreigners, by age and gender.

8. **Proportion of population by age group, sex and country of birth** (demo_poppcctb)  
   *ELI5*: Similar to above but focused on where people were born rather than their citizenship.

## Relevant World Bank Indicators

### Population and Migration
1. **Net migration**  
   *ELI5*: The total number of immigrants minus the total number of emigrants over a period.

2. **Population growth (annual %)**  
   *ELI5*: How fast a country's population is increasing (includes both natural growth and migration).

3. **International migrant stock, total**  
   *ELI5*: The total number of people born in a country other than the one they live in.

4. **Urban population (% of total population)**  
   *ELI5*: What percentage of the country's population lives in cities and towns.

### Economic Indicators (Control Variables)
5. **GDP per capita (current US$)**  
   *ELI5*: How much economic output is generated per person in a country, indicating wealth.

6. **Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)**  
   *ELI5*: How much prices are increasing each year, affecting purchasing power.

7. **Unemployment, total (% of total labor force)**  
   *ELI5*: The percentage of people who want to work but don't have jobs.

8. **Real interest rate (%)**  
   *ELI5*: The cost of borrowing money adjusted for inflation, affecting mortgage costs.

9. **Gross savings (% of GDP)**  
   *ELI5*: How much of a country's income is being saved rather than spent, affecting investment in housing.

### Housing-Specific Indicators
10. **Real estate price indices**  
    *ELI5*: Measures how housing prices are changing over time.

11. **Rental price indices**  
    *ELI5*: Measures how the cost of renting is changing over time.
